# CQL Grammar

[CQL](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html) is a SQL-like language used with Apache Cassandra. This
library provides a grammar for lexing and parsing CQL.

The grammar is defined using [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/), from which Java sources are generated and subsequently
compiled.
